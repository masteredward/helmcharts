# masteredward's Helm Charts

Here you can find all the charts I've created for installing software in my Kubernetes Clusters. Fell free to browse and fork!

- [cloudflare-issuer](https://github.com/masteredward/helmcharts/tree/main/charts/cloudflare-issuer) - Deploys a cert-manager ClusterIssuer and a Secret containing a Cloudflare's API token.
- [simple-minio](https://github.com/masteredward/helmcharts/tree/main/charts/simple-minio) - Deploys a standalone Minio server and an Ingress file to provide SSL connection to both it's API and Console.
